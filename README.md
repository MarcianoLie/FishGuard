Project Name: FishGuard

# FishGuard
Theme : Smart Agri-Fishery Solution: Agrotech and Fisheries Technology Integration

The depletion of fish populations affected by overfishing, illegal trade, and poor awareness among fishermen and anglers poses a severe threat to marine biodiversity and forcing several species of fishes under protection into extinction. In Indonesia, where fishing is not only a source of livelihood but also part of the culture, lack of knowledge on protected species leads to unsustainable practices that jeopardize the ecosystem. Many fishers and anglers coincidentally catch and sell vulnerable species, continuing to drive them further toward extinction and destabilize marine ecosystems. Our app, FishGuard, is an innovative application to meet these critical challenges. Applying image recognition technology, FishGuard helps fishermen, anglers, and conservationists instantly identify fish species and learn their protection status. This tool will enable the user to make an informed decision on whether or not to capture or trade protected species. Indirectly, FishGuard contributes to education about responsible fish sorting and marine life protection and increases understanding regarding the conservation of biodiversity.
